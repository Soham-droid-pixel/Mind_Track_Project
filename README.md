3. **Run the application**# MindTrack: Mental Health Sentiment Analyzer üß†

   ```bash

   streamlit run app/app.py## Model Description

   ```

MindTrack is a fine-tuned DistilBERT model specifically trained for mental health sentiment analysis and risk detection in text content. The model can classify text into two categories:

## üéØ How It Works

- **Normal**: Indicates healthy mental state or neutral content

MindTrack uses a fine-tuned DistilBERT model hosted on Hugging Face Hub to classify text into two categories:- **Risk Detected**: Indicates potential mental health concerns that may require attention



- **Normal**: Healthy mental state or neutral content## Model Details

- **Risk Detected**: Potential mental health concerns requiring attention

- **Model Type**: DistilBERT for Sequence Classification

### Model Performance- **Training Data**: Curated mental health dataset with balanced samples

- **Accuracy**: 97.13%- **Languages**: English

- **F1-Score**: 97.16% (Normal), 97.10% (Risk)- **License**: MIT

- **Confidence**: Provides reliable confidence scores for predictions

## Performance

## üõ†Ô∏è Technology Stack

- **Accuracy**: N/A

- **Frontend**: Streamlit with custom CSS styling- **F1 Score**: N/A

- **ML Model**: Fine-tuned DistilBERT (hosted on Hugging Face Hub)- **Training Samples**: N/A

- **Explainability**: LIME (Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations)

- **APIs**: Reddit API (PRAW) for social media monitoring## Usage

- **Deployment**: Streamlit Community Cloud

```python

## üìä Use Casesfrom transformers import AutoTokenizer, AutoModelForSequenceClassification

import torch

1. **Content Moderation**: Identify potentially harmful content

2. **Mental Health Screening**: Early detection of concerning language patterns# Load model and tokenizer

3. **Social Media Monitoring**: Track mental health trends in communitiesmodel_id = "techhy/mindtrack-mental-health-analyzer"

4. **Research Tool**: Analyze large datasets for mental health indicatorstokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_id)

model = AutoModelForSequenceClassification.from_pretrained(model_id)

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Disclaimer

# Example usage

This tool is designed to assist in identifying potential mental health concerns but should **never replace professional medical advice**. If you or someone you know is experiencing mental health difficulties, please seek help from qualified professionals.text = "I am feeling great today!"

inputs = tokenizer(text, return_tensors="pt", truncation=True, padding=True, max_length=512)

### Crisis Resources

- **National Suicide Prevention Lifeline**: 988with torch.no_grad():

- **Crisis Text Line**: Text HOME to 741741    outputs = model(**inputs)

- **International Association for Suicide Prevention**: [https://www.iasp.info](https://www.iasp.info)    probabilities = torch.softmax(outputs.logits, dim=-1)

    predicted_class = torch.argmax(probabilities, dim=-1).item()

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture    confidence = probabilities[0][predicted_class].item()



```labels = {0: "Normal", 1: "Risk Detected"}

MindTrack/print(f"Prediction: {labels[predicted_class]} (Confidence: {confidence:.2%})")

```

- Trained primarily on English text

## üìà Model Details- May not capture cultural nuances in mental health expression

- Performance may vary on text significantly different from training data

The MindTrack model is available on Hugging Face Hub: [`techhy/mindtrack-mental-health-analyzer`](https://huggingface.co/techhy/mindtrack-mental-health-analyzer)- Should be used as a screening tool, not for final diagnosis



### Usage Example## Training Data

```python

from transformers import AutoTokenizer, AutoModelForSequenceClassificationThe model was trained on a carefully curated dataset of mental health-related text, including:

import torch- Social media posts (anonymized)

- Mental health support forum discussions

model_id = "techhy/mindtrack-mental-health-analyzer"- Clinical text samples (anonymized)

tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_id)- Balanced representation of risk and normal states

model = AutoModelForSequenceClassification.from_pretrained(model_id)

## Ethical Considerations

text = "I am feeling great today!"

inputs = tokenizer(text, return_tensors="pt", truncation=True, padding=True)- **Privacy**: No personal information was used in training

- **Bias**: Efforts were made to reduce bias, but some may remain

with torch.no_grad():- **Responsible Use**: Should be used to help people, not to discriminate

    outputs = model(**inputs)- **Professional Guidance**: Always recommend professional help for mental health concerns

    probabilities = torch.softmax(outputs.logits, dim=-1)

    predicted_class = torch.argmax(probabilities, dim=-1).item()## Citation



labels = {0: "Normal", 1: "Risk Detected"}If you use this model in your research or applications, please cite:

print(f"Prediction: {labels[predicted_class]}")
